📊 Predictive Modeling for Application Abandonment
📌 Project Overview

This project addresses a common challenge in the financial services and e-commerce industry: customers often abandon their online credit card applications before submission, leading to significant lost conversions.

The goal was to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of abandonment based on real-time user session behavior, and to recommend data-driven UI/UX improvements to reduce drop-offs.

🔍 Business Problem

Customers start but do not finish online applications.

High abandonment leads to lost revenue and missed customer acquisition opportunities.

Need: Proactive intervention strategy to save at-risk users in real-time.

🎯 Objectives

Predict the probability of a user abandoning an application.

Identify the key drivers of abandonment.

Provide recommendations for UI/UX improvements.

Enable real-time interventions (e.g., live chat trigger).

🛠️ Methodology

Synthetic Data Generation (Pandas, NumPy) – Simulated monthly data (Jan–Dec 2024) including features like device type, marketing channel, time on page, errors, and submissions.

Feature Engineering – Created ratios (submit ratio, approval ratio), error flags, and scaled/encoded features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (Matplotlib, Seaborn) – Identified mobile users, form errors, and low submit ratios as key friction points.

Modeling (Scikit-learn, XGBoost)

Logistic Regression → Interpretability (odds ratios for business insights)

XGBoost → High accuracy risk scoring (probability outputs)

Model Evaluation – Both models achieved AUC-ROC > 0.99 with high precision and recall.

📈 Results

Logistic Regression

AUC-ROC: 0.993

Precision: 0.989 | Recall: 0.932

Odds Ratios: Mobile users (6.9B), Errors (7.7K+) → strong abandonment drivers

XGBoost

AUC-ROC: 0.993

Precision: 1.0 | Recall: 0.922

Top Features: Mobile device, app submits, total errors, pre-fill usage

💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

Mobile users are most at risk → prioritize mobile UX optimization.

Form errors (SSN mismatches, page load, dead clicks) drive abandonment → implement real-time validation & pre-fill.

Low submit ratios signal friction → guide users with proactive support.

Proposed live chat intervention when risk score > 70%.

🚀 Impact

Predictive model enables real-time risk scoring of users.

Insights guided UI/UX changes, currently under A/B testing to measure improvements.

Data-driven strategy shifts business from “guesswork” → evidence-based conversion optimization.
